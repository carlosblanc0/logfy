Calendly-alternative (bit of a stretch, I know) app I built using Express.js and EJS. The production build is currently being deployed using Heroku, whereas the landing page is a simple static vanilla JS page being served with Netlify.

## Navigating the app
```bash
Manually add/delete items one-by-one
Click "Save" or "Cancel"
Entry gets added to the dashboard
```


## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/carloswhite/logfy.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd logfy
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install 
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
